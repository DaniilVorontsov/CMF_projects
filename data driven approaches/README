Future move price prediction.
Data-driven approaches for predicting an asset price future move over a mid-term horizon.

The problem has its roots in high-frequency trading, where it is usually necessary to solve two tasks:
1) pricing (price prediction, i.e. where the price of the traded asset will be in the near future)
2) ordering (which orders need to be sent to the market to exploit prediction).
