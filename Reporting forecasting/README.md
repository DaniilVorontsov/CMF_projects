Financial statements of American oil and gas companies.
The task is to build a forecast of Revenue and Operating Income indicators for each company.
It can be a uniform formula for all, or individual models.

The data is spread out in two folders: in the oil gas train test folder the most complete set, in the oil gas train folder - the same companies, but all time series are shortened by a year. For this missing year, we need to make a forecast. To build a forecast, you can use all reporting indicators, as well as any set of external data: macroeconomic factors, exchange rates, commodity prices, etc.

To assess the quality of the forecast, you will need a metric that can answer the questions of how well revenue and profit are predicted separately, how good is the forecast of the revenue-profit pair and what is the quality of forecasts for the entire set of companies. You will always be able to calculate this metric, since the actual values for the forecast period will be known in the oil gas train test folder.

The format of the solution is a Python laptop.
